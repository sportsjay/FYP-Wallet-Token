### About
Greetings, I am Jason Nathaniel, Nanyang Technological University student, cohort 2018-2022, majoring in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. This project serves as on one of 3 applications to my final year project. 
It is the 2nd application to be developed where it consists of 2 modules, a mobile application and a backend server directly communicating with the Ethereum network. 
Each application is to be run locally, this also accounts for a local EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine).
